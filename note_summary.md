* Design is achieving goals within constraints, involving trade-offs between goals and constraints.
* The golden rules of design in HCI are understanding humans (psychology, social aspects, errors) and computers (limitations, capacities, tools).
* The design process is iterative and involves requirements, analysis, design, iteration & prototyping, and implementation & deployment.
* Software process in HCI, often modeled using a waterfall model, includes requirement specification, architectural design, detailed design, coding & unit testing, integration & testing, and maintenance.
* Usability should be considered early in the design process, and the iterative nature of design should be incorporated into the software development lifecycle.
