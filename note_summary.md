* Design is achieving goals within constraints, involving trade-offs between goals and constraints.
* The golden rules of design in HCI involve understanding humans (psychological, social, and error) and computers (limitations, capacities).
* The design process is iterative and includes requirements, analysis, design, iteration & prototyping, and implementation & deployment.
* Software process in HCI, often using a waterfall model, adds stages like requirement specification, architectural design, detailed design, coding & unit testing, integration & testing, and maintenance.
* Usability considerations must be integrated into the design process from its early stages.
